# LeNet5 in TensorFlow 

This was my first attempt at building a deep neural network (before I decided to make the jump to PyTorch) 
To learn more about my ML/DL progress, guide yourself to the ComputerVision repo instead. 

If you're new to ML/DL and want to see a starter project, this repo has some cool code and a slide deck that explains it. 

Good luck :)
